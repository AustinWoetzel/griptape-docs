# Welcome to the first griptape.js tutorial! 

If you jumped here without taking a look at [Introductory](/) section we admire your go-getter spirit, but it may be helpful to take a look first. It goes of what the goal of Griptape.js, why we built it, and importantly, why we call it Griptape.js. It's truly awe inspiring.

Before we get going, it's important to know that this tutorial is for the Vue.js flavor of gripape. One of the key parts of griptape is the idea of griptape-flavors, such as griptape.vue, griptape.react, and griptape.svelte. Right now Vue is the only flavor available, so don't worry, there is not place else you could be.

In this tutorial we're going to build a sealed bid auction app. We won't build the entire app you will find in auctions.scrt.network yet, but we will get pretty close. Although how close depends on how much of this we've finished. Right now that isn't all that much, but it is enough to get you an app where you can view open auctions, so that's not nothing. 

Without any more blabber, lets get started!
