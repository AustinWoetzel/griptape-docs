# Welcome to the first griptape.js tutorial! 

If you haven't yet take a look at the introduction for background on why we created Griptape. One of the key parts of griptape is the idea of griptape-flavors. This tutorial is written for the griptape-vue flavor. The idetical tutorial for the griptape-react flavor is coming soon.

In this tutorial we're going to build a sealed bid auctions front-end. We won't build the entire app you will find in auctions.scrt.network yet, but eventually we will get there. But for now you will learn the basics of griptape and end up with a ui that allows you to see all the open auction as well as the auctions you have created or bid on.

Lets get started!
