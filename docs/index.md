::: warning
This docs are for the *beta* release of griptape.js and griptape-vue.js.
:::

Griptape.js is an opinionated, web application front-end framework for developing DApps in Secret Network.

## Why Griptape?

Griptape is an essential part of the skate setup. Not only provides the traction necessary to keep your foot on the
board, but it helps a lot when doing advance stuff like tricks; the real focus of most skaters.

While developing DApps, we found a lot of patterns and good practices that can help you quickly get your application up
and running and start focusing on what your application has to do. We call it griptape because is the layer that helps
with all the core of your app; it helps you get off the ground.

## What is Griptape-vue.js?

griptape-vue.js is an implementation of the griptape.js core library for [Vue.js](https://v3.vuejs.org/). We call it
griptape, but Vue.js flavored (many other flavors coming soon).
