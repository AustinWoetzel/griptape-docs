# What is griptape.js?

> This docs are for the beta release of griptape.js and griptape-vue.js

griptape.js is an opinionated, web application front-end library for developing dApps for Secret Network.

## Why Griptape?

Griptape is an essential part of the skate setup. Not only provides the traction necessary to keep your foot on the
board, but help you a lot when doing advance stuff like tricks.

When developing dApps, you have to setup your app by connecting many pieces before you can start by doing what your app
is suppose to do. That's why we  call it griptape, because it is the layer that helps you get off the ground.

## What is griptape-vue.js?

griptape-vue.js is an implementation of the griptape.js core library for [Vue.js](https://v3.vuejs.org/). We call it
griptape, but Vue.js flavored (many other flavors comming soon).
