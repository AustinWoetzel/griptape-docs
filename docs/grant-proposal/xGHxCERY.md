## Project Description
Griptape.js is a front-end Secret Network application development framework written in Javascript. It was built to get Secret Network app developers off the ground quickly. With a rich feature set and opinionated design methodology, Griptape.js will allow developers to focus on building what makes their app unique, not what it shares in common with every other app.

## Detailed Description
For a thorough understanding of what Griptape.js is, what problems it solves, and how it solves them, please visit our documentation [Here](https://docs.vue.griptapejs.com). To summarize though, Griptape.js helps developers build apps on Secret Network. It does this by providing all the necessary parts an application needs to work, but also through an opinionated architecture that removes many of the fundamental decisions that are hard enough to make when your backend isn’t a blockchain with encrypted state. In other words, it makes things easier.

Just Install Griptape.js and you have an environment ready to begin talking to the blockchain and the secret contracts running on it.

## Problem / Solution
**Problem:** Developing web applications on Secret Network is hard, and the solutions that people have developed are all doing the sames things in different ways, some more successfully than others.

**Solution:** Griptape makes application development significantly easier by providing common components, utilities, and preconfigured libraries by default. In addition the framework gives you a structured way to organize the different parts of the application so that you don't need to think about... And the way it structures the application is an extremely intuitive one that has the amazing effect of getting front end and back end devs speaking the same language.

## Value Capture for Secret Network Ecosystem
The challenges of developing contracts on Secret Network are well understood. Less well understood and arguably under-appreciated, are the challenges of developing user interfaces for those applications. Whether it’s the current need for every developer to build the same features independently, the amount of boiler plate code required to be written for each task, or the fact that design decisions around viewing keys and state management, if done incorrectly, can lead to frustrating UX and even network wide performance issues; the need for a unified set of tools is clear.

At the same time, javascript tools do exist that make it easier than it has ever been to build complex performant applications for the web. It is fair to say that any developer who comes to the doors of Secret Network will be familiar with Vue.js or React.js, and probably both.

We feel strongly that the growth of Secret Network depends on helping usher these folks through the door by allowing them to be comfortable on day one. Griptape.js will do this by connecting the technologies people already know with the Secret Network tools that are revolutionary, but at the moment, difficult to use.

## Development Roadmap

Before describing the roadmap I have good news, the project is live right now.
That's right, you can start using it today. To really get a feel for our vision, read technical documentation, and even follow a simple tutorial to build a functional app, visit [griptapejs.com](https://griptapejs.com) & [docs.vue.griptapejs.com](https://docs.vue.griptapejs.com).

The current build is far from perfect, we only have the vue-flavor, and a lot of features are still at an early stage, but what we have currently is significant. In fact we are using it internally at Stake or Die to build our next project.

So from a roadmap standpoint we are already 2 months down the road and have a significate feature set.

### Current Feature Set
- Griptape.js - v0.2.12
- Griptape-vue.js - v0.2.22

- Early Docs
- Partial Tutorial
### Completed Feature Set
- Griptape - v1.0.0
- Griptape-vue - v1.0.0
- Griptape-react - v1.0.0
- Poser - (Mock Library)
- Joystick - (State Orchestration)
- Prodigy - (Server)
- Skateshop-cli - (app scaffold and schema-to-contract-defintion builder)
- Griptape-ui Library

- Full Documention
- Video and Text Tutorials
- Office Hours
- Public Release Meetings/Demos
- 3 Hackathons
### Process
The development will be done using Agile Development Methodology. Progress will be made in 2 week sprints with working releases at the end of each. Our budget calls for 12 sprints (24 weeks) of development

## Grant request

We are requesting a total of $95,940 USD (91371.43 SCRT based on 7 trailing average) broken into 2 parts, 45,685.72 SCRT each, with 2 seperate grant applications. The first 6 sprints will focus on improving the overall architecture and feature set and implementing the react-flavor. After that, if approved, the second 6 sprints will be implementing Poser, Joystick, Prodigy and Skateshop-CLI as well as building out the Griptape-ui library. Although this is the basic plan, we expect priorities to shift based on constant interations and the knowledge that we will aquire along the way.

In addition to these hours we have provided, and will provide, a significant amount of work and services for no charge. They include:

- The initial 2-3 Months of development it took to get the project where it is today.
- 1 hour weekly office hours in which Sandy and Luis will be available for support, feedback, and ideation with the community (First hour was attending by 10+ community members).
- 1 hour bi-weekly live release/demo meetings at the conclusion of each sprint
- 2 "Hackathons" (at the end of each phase), sponsored by Stake or Die, in which a common contract worked on by different teams to build different UIs.
- Free video tutorials demonstrating solutions to common issues.
