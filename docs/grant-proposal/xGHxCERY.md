## Project Description
Griptape.js is a framework built to get Secret Network UI developers off the ground quickly. With a feature set, and opinionated design methodology, Griptape.js allows UI developers to focus on building what makes their app unique, not what every other app shares in common.

The challenges of developing contracts on Secret Network are well understood. Less well understood and arguably underappreciated, are the challenges of developing user interfaces for these applications. Whether itâ€™s the current need for every developer to build the same features independently, the amount of boiler plate code required to be written for each task, or the fact that design decisions around viewing keys and state management, if done incorrectly, can lead to network wide performance issues; the need for a unified set of tools is clear. Today, with Griptape.js, we take the first step in providing those tools, and we ask for support moving forward.

## Detailed Description
For a detailed description, and to test out the current public beta, please visit [griptapejs.com](https://griptapejs.com) & [docs.vue.griptapejs.com](https://docs.vue.griptapejs.com).

## Problem / Solution
**Problem:** Developing web applications on Secret Network is hard, and the solutions that people have developed are all doing the sames things in different ways, some more successfully than others.

**Solution:** Griptape makes application development significantly easier by providing common components, utilities, and preconfigured libraries by default. In addition the framework gives you a structured way to organize the different parts of the application so that you don't need to think about... And the way it structures the application is an extremely intuitive one that has the amazing effect of getting front end and back end devs speaking the same language.

## Value capture for Secret Network Ecosystem
For better or worse web development is the entry point for the vast majority of young developers. JS tools like React, Vue, Svelte, and others have made developing for the web easier and easier. As these developers discover the power of a decentralized future, they are eager to find their place in it. We feel strongly that the growth of Secret Network depends in part on attracting these folks. If intuitive enough, they can learn to build on Secret Network quickly and stick around, if however the barrier of entry is too high, they will go elsewhere. That is why we are building Griptape.js, to make building UIs fun and intuitive, but also to make Secret Network sticky with developers. If we succeed, this tool will help grow our ranks of the people we need to build our products, and in turn build our network.

So essentially I see Griptape as a force multiplier. The more adoption it gets the more feedback and contribution we get, the better it gets. The better it gets, the more developers want to build on Secret Network, and the more projects get built. The more projects the more money flows into the network making the price go up and so on and so forth.

## Development Roadmap
### It's Alive
Before describing the roadmap I have good news, the project is live right now. That's right, you can start using it right now. It's not perfect, we are in public beta, we only have the vue-flavor, and a lot of features are still at an early stage, but what we have currenlty is significant. In fact we are using it internally at Stake or Die to build our own projects. So from a roadmap standpoint we are already 2 months down the road and have a significate feature set.

### Current Feature Set
- Griptape.js - v0.2.5
- Griptape-vue.js - v0.2.5

- Early Docs
- Partial Tutorial
### Completed Feature Set
- Griptape - v1.0.0
- Griptape-vue - v1.0.0
- Griptape-react - v1.0.0
- Poser - (Mock Library)
- Skateshop-cli - (app scaffold and schema-to-contract-defintion builder)
- Joystick - (State Orchestration)
- Prodigy - (Server)

- Full Documention
- Video and Text Tutorials
- Office Hours
- Public Release Meetings/Demos
- 3 Hackathons
### Process
The development will be done using Agile Development Methodology. Progress will be made in 2 week sprints will working releases at the end of each. Our budget calls for 13 sprints (26 weeks) of development

## Grant request
We are requesting $96,958.33 SCRT ($104,715.00 USD based on 1 week trailing average). This will pay for 13 Sprints (two weeks each). Below is the rate and position table:

| Billables                     | Sprints | Rate                    | Hours Per Sprint | Total            |
|-------------------------------|---------|-------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Senior Full Stack Developer   | 13      |  $               37.50  | 80               |  $   39,000.00   |
| Senior Full Stack Develope    | 13      |  $               37.50  | 80               |  $   39,000.00   |
| 1 QA Engineer (80 Hours)      | 13      |  $               28.00  | 60               |  $   21,840.00   |
| 1 Technical Writer (20 Hours) | 13      |  $               25.00  | 15               |  $    4,875.00   |
| Total                         |         |                         | 235              |  $   104,715.00  |

In addition to these hours we have provided, and will provide, a significant amount of work and services for no charge. They include:

- The initial 2 Months of development it took to get the project where it is today.
- 1-2 hours (depending on participation) of office hours in which Sandy and Luis will be available for support, feedback, and ideation with the community
- 1 hour bi-weekly live release/demo meetings at the conclusion of each sprint
- 3 bi-monthly "Hackathons", sponsored by Stake or Die, in which a common contract will be used to develop multiple UIs.
- Free video tutorials demonstrating solutions to common issues.
